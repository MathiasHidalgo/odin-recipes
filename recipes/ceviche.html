<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>is a Peruvian appetizer of boiled potatoes in a spicy, creamy sauce made of queso fresco (fresh white cheese) and sautéed or grilled ají amarillo (yellow Peruvian pepper), red onion and garlic, all traditionally ground or pounded in a batán</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    fish
    lime juice
    onions
    chilli peppers
    salt
    cilantro
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Place the fish cubes in a non-reactive bowl (glass or ceramic is ideal).
    </li>
    <li>
        Let the fish marinate in the lime juice for about 10-15 minutes in the refrigerator. This acid "cooks" the fish, denaturing the proteins. The timing can vary based on how "cooked" you like your ceviche; less time for a rawer texture, more for a firmer texture.
    </li>
    <li>
        While the fish is marinating, you can soak the sliced onions in ice water for about 10 minutes to reduce their sharpness. Drain well.
    </li>
    <li>
        After the fish has marinated, drain most of the lime juice, leaving just enough to keep the mixture moist but not soupy. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve immediately to enjoy the freshness. Portion into bowls or plates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optionally, you can garnish with a few fresh cilantro leaves or a thin slice of lime for an extra touch of color and freshness.
    </li>
</ul>
